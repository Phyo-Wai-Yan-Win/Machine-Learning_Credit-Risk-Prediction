# Credit Risk Prediction with Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning algorithms to enhance credit risk assessment in the lending industry. Four machine learning models - **Naive Bayes**, **Support Vector Machine**, **Random Forest**, and **Logistic Regression** - were trained and evaluated using a dataset from Midwestern State University, Texas.

## Key Outcomes

- **Model Selection:** Random Forest and Support Vector Classifier (SVC) models performed well and were selected for further optimization through hyperparameter tuning.
- **Performance:** Random Forest showed robustness and a good trade-off between accuracy and AUC.
- **Insights:** The project underscores the critical role of machine learning in credit risk assessment and highlights important considerations for future work.
