# Credit Risk Prediction with Machine Learning

Leveraging the power of machine learning, this project transforms credit risk evaluation, enabling more informed and strategic decision-making in the financial sector.Four machine learning models - **Naive Bayes**, **Support Vector Machine**, **Random Forest**, and **Logistic Regression** - were trained and evaluated using a dataset from Midwestern State University, Texas.

## Key Outcomes

- **Model Selection:** Random Forest and Support Vector Classifier (SVC) models performed well and were selected for further optimization through hyperparameter tuning.
- **Performance:** Random Forest showed robustness and a good trade-off between accuracy and AUC.
- **Insights:** The project underscores the critical role of machine learning in credit risk assessment and highlights important considerations for future work.

## Technical Details

The project was developed using Python, with significant use of the **"pandas"** library for data manipulation and analysis, **"sklearn"** for machine learning tasks, and **"matplotlib"** for data visualization.

## Getting Started
